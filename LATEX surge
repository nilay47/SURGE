\section{Introduction}
The Okun’s Law proposed by Arthur Melvin Okun in 1962 establishes a relationship between unemployment and GDP, whereby a percentage increase in unemployment causes a 2\% fall in GDP.
\vfill
The relation between fertility rate and GDP growth also has been a topic of research. The majority of the literature points towards the initial increase of fertility rate with economic growth and the subsequent decline in fertility rate after the economic growth.
\vfill
These results point out to the fact that the dependence of the fertility rate with GDP growth might depend on the fact if the country is a developing or a developed one. 
\vfill
A recent 2016 study entitled ‘Economic Growth & Income Inequality: A revised cross-sectional econometric analysis of the global impact of income inequality on economic growth around the world’ was published in Econometric Analysis U.G. Research by A. Hunter, W. Martinez, & U. Patel of Georgia Institute of Technology by S. Dhongde.
\vfill
This paper examines the effects of inequality on GDP per capita growth in the year 2007 for 74 countries, both developed and developing ones around the world with the World Bank data and compares that relationship to other impactful factors on economic growth like Gross Savings Rate, Fertility Rate, and the Unemployment rate. The paper uses GINI coefficient as a measure of the income inequality. The results show positive relationship between unemployment and economic growth, quite contrary to Okun’s Law. The results also show positive relation of economic growth between GDP per capita growth in the year 2007 with GINI, Gross savings rate and fertility rate.
\vfill
We believe that the possible reasons for the counter relationship between GDP growth and unemployment might be MultiCollinearity among the covariates and violation of the weak exogeneity assumption between the covariates and the error in the model. The problem of Multicollinearty produces wrong results and thus needs to be solved. The Multicollinearity between the covariates can be identified with the hep of the Variance Inflation Factor and some of the covariates need to be dropped which is done with the help of Subset Regression Models.
\vfill
This paper differs from the earlier paper on the fact that the time series regression is done on the 11 countries for the year range of 2002 to 2016 and the various countries make 11 models which include 4 developed and 7 developing countries. The measure used in this paper is also opposed to the one used in the earlier version. We have proposed that the GDP growth rate is a better measure of economic growth of a country. The other contribution of this work is to indicate the opposing relationship of the fertility rate and economic growth with the chane in the economy from a developed to a developing one.
\vfill 
The paper proceeds in the following order: First part contains the relevant theory in this area and the previous literature. The second part includes the Data used by us in our simulations. The third part consists of the detailed results produced by us and the conclusion drawn. The last part consists of the References and the Appendix which includes the detailed statistics of our results.

\section{Linear Regression} \label{sec:Model}
 Regression analysis is a statistical technique for investigating and modeling the
relationship between variables . Applications of regression are numerous and occur
in almost every fi eld, including engineering, the physical and chemical sciences,
economics, management, life and biological sciences, and the social sciences. In fact,
regression analysis may be the most widely used statistical technique. 
\subsection{Simple Linear Regression Model}
Simple linear regression model , that is, a model with a
single regressor x that has a relationship with a response y that is a straight line. This simple linear regression model is
\begin{equation}
  y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x + \epsilon
\end{equation}
where the intercept $\beta_0$ and the slope $\beta_1$ are unknown constants and $\epsilon$ is a random error component. The errors are assumed to have mean zero and unknown variance $\sigma^2$. Additionally we usually assume that the errors are uncorrelated. This means that
the value of one error does not depend on the value of any other error. 

\subsection{Multiple Linear Regression Model}
A regression model that involves more than one regressor variable is called a multiple regression model.In general, the response y may be related to k regressor or predictor variables.\\
The model
\begin{equation}
    y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 +.....+ \beta_k x_k + \epsilon
\end{equation}
is called a mnltiple linear regression model with k regressors. The parameters $\beta_j$ , j = 0, 1,...., k , are called the regression coefficients . This model describes a hyperplane in the k - dimensional space of the regressor variables $x_j$ . The parameter $\beta_j$ represents the expected change in the response y per unit change in $x_j$ when all of
the remaining regressor variables $x_i$ ( i $\ne$ j ) are held constant . For this reason the parameters $\beta_j$ , j = 1, 2,...., k , are often called partial regression coefficients .
It is more convenient to deal with multiple regression models if they are expressed in matrix notation. This allows a very compact display of the model, data, and results. In matrix notation, the model given by Eq. (2) is
\begin{equation}
    \pmb{y = X \mathbf{\beta} + \epsilon}
\end{equation}
where\\
\begin{center}
    \textbf{y} = \begin{pmatrix}
$y_1$\\$y_2$\\$y_3$\\.\\.\\.\\$y_k$
\end{pmatrix}
\textbf{X} = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & $x_{11}$ & $x_{12}$ & ... & $x_{1k}$\\
1 & $x_{21}$ & $x_{22}$ & ... & $x_{2k}$\\
.&.&.&...&.\\.&.&.&...&.\\.&.&.&...&.\\
1 & $x_{n1}$ & $x_{n2}$ & ... & $x_{nk}$
\end{pmatrix}
\end{center}\\
\begin{center}
    \pmb{$\beta$} = \begin{pmatrix}
$\beta_1$\\$\beta_2$\\$\beta_3$\\.\\.\\.\\$\beta_k$ 
\end{pmatrix}
    \pmb{$\epsilon$} = \begin{pmatrix}
$\epsilon_1$\\$\epsilon_2$\\$\epsilon_3$\\.\\.\\.\\$\epsilon_k$ 
\end{pmatrix}
\end{center}
\\ In general, \textbf{y} is an n x 1 vector of the observations, \textbf{X} is an n x p matrix of the levels
of the regressor variables, \pmb{$\beta$} is a p x 1 vector of the regression coefficients, and \pmb{$\epsilon$} is
an n x 1 vector of random errors. 

\subsection{Ordinary Least Squares(OLS) Estimator}
The method of least squares can be used to estimate the regression coefficients in eq. (2) . Suppose that n $>$ k observations are available, and let $y_i$ denote the $i^{th}$
observed response and x$_ij$ denote the $i^{th}$ observation or level of regressor x$_j$ . The
data will appear as in Table 3.1 . We assume that the error term \epsilon in the model has
E($\epsilon$) = 0, Var($\epsilon$) = $\sigma^2$ , and that the errors are uncorrelated. 
\\
We wish to find the vector of least squares estimators,  $\hat{\pmb{\beta}}$, that minimizes the mean square error term 
\begin{center}
    S(\pmb{$\beta$})=$\sum_{i=1}^{n} \epsilon_i^2$ = \pmb{$\epsilon$}$\mathbf{'}$\pmb{$\epsilon$} = \textbf{(y - X\pmb{$\beta$})}$\mathbf{'}$\textbf{(y - X\pmb{$\beta$})}
\end{center}
which is given by,
\begin{equation}
    \hat{\pmb{\beta}} = \mathbf{(X'X)^{-1}X'y}
\end{equation}
 provided that the inverse matrix $(\mathbf{X'X})^{-1}$ exists. The $(\mathbf{X'X})^{-1}$ matrix will always exist
if the regressors are linearly independent , that is, if no column of the X matrix is a
linear combination of the other columns.
\newpage
\section{Multicollinearity}
 If there is no linear relationship between the regressors, they are said to be orthogonal. However, in some situations the regressors are nearly perfectly linearly related, and in such cases the inferences based on the regression model can be misleading or erroneous. When there are near - linear dependencies among the regressors, the problem of multicollinearity is said to exist.
 
\subsection{Sources of Multicollinearity}
 We write the multiple regression model as
 \begin{center}
      $\pmb{y = X \mathbf{\beta} + \epsilon}$
 \end{center}
 \\ Where, \textbf{y} is an n x 1 vector of the observations, \textbf{X} is an n x p matrix of the levels
of the regressor variables, \pmb{$\beta$} is a p x 1 vector of the regression coefficients, and \pmb{$\epsilon$} is
an n x 1 vector of random errors where \pmb{$\epsilon$} \sim \mathcal{N}($0,\,\sigma^{2}$).\\
Consequently, $\mathbf{X'X}$ is a p x p matrix of correlations † between the regressors and
$\mathbf{X'y}$ is a p x 1 vector of correlations between the regressors and the response. Let the $j^{th}$ column of the \textbf{X} matrix be denoted $\mathbf{X_j}$ , so that \textbf{X} = [ $\mathbf{X_1}$ , $\mathbf{X_2}$ , . . . , $\mathbf{X_p}$ ]. 
Thus, $\mathbf{X_j}$ contains the n levels of the $j^{th}$ regressor variable. We may formally define
multicollinearity in terms of the linear dependence of the columns of X . The vectors
$\mathbf{X_1}$ , $\mathbf{X_2}$ , . . . , $\mathbf{X_p}$ are linearly dependent if there is a set of constants $t_1$ , $t_2$ , . . . , $t_p$ , not
all zero, such that
\begin{equation}
    \sum_{j=1}^{p} t_j\mathbf{X_j} = 0  
\end{equation}
 If Eq. (5) holds exactly for a subset of the columns of X , then the rank of the $\mathbf{X'X}$
matrix is less than p and $\mathbf{X'X}^-{-1}$
 does not exist. However, suppose that Eq. (9.1) is
approximately true for some subset of the columns of X . Then there will be a near -
 linear dependency in $\mathbf{X'X}$ and the problem of multicollinearity is said to exist. Note
that multicollinearity is a form of ill - conditioning in the $\mathbf{X'X}$ matrix. Furthermore,
the problem is one of degree, that is, every data set will suffer from multicollinearity
to some extent unless the columns of $\mathbf{X}$ are orthogonal.\\\\
There are four primary sources of multicollinearity :\\
 1. The data collection method employed\\
 2. Constraints on the model or in the population\\
 3. Model specification\\
 4. An overdefined model \\
 
\subsection{Effects of Multicollinearity}
For the case of Multiple Regressors, multicollinearity produces
similar effects. It can be shown that the diagonal elements of the \textbf{C} = $\mathbf{(X'X)}^{-1}$ matrix are
\begin{equation}
    C_{jj} = \frac{1}{1-R_j^2}   ,    j = 1,2,...p
\end{equation}
 
 where $R_j^2$
 is the coefficient of multiple determination from the regression of $x_j$ on the remaining p − 1 regressor variables. If there is strong multicollinearity between
$x_j$ and any subset of the other p − 1, regressors, then the value of $R_j^2$ will be close to unity. Since the variance of ˆ
$\beta_j$ is Var($\beta_j$) = $C_{jj}\sigma^{2}$ = $(1 - R_j^2)^{-1}\sigma^{2}$ , strong multicollinearity
implies that the variance of the least - squares estimate of the regression
coefficient $\beta_j$ is very large 
 
Multicollinearity also tends to produce least - squares estimates $\hat{\beta}$
 that are too
large in absolute value. To see this, consider the squared distance from $\hat{\pmb{\beta}}$ to the true
parameter vector $\pmb{\beta}$ , for example,

\begin{center}
    $L_1^2$ = ${(\hat{\pmb{\beta}}-\pmb{\beta})'(\hat{\pmb{\beta}}-\pmb{\beta})}$\\
\end{center}
Where expected squred distance, E($L_1^2$) is
\begin{center}
    E($L_1^2$) = E(${(\hat{\pmb{\beta}}-\pmb{\beta})'(\hat{\pmb{\beta}}-\pmb{\beta})}$) = $\sum_{j=1}^{p}E((\hat{\beta}-\beta))^2$\\
     =$\sum_{j=1}^{p}Var(\hat{\beta_j})$ = $\sigma^{2}Tr(\mathbf{X'X})$
\end{center}
Which gives,
\begin{equation}
  E(L_1^2) = \sigma^{2}Tr(\mathbf{X'X}^{-1})    
\end{equation}
where the trace of a matrix (abbreviated Tr) is just the sum of the main diagonal
elements. When there is multicollinearity present, some of the eigenvalues of $\mathbf{X'X}$
will be small. Since the trace of a matrix is also equal to the sum of its eigenvalues,
Eq. (7) becomes
\begin{equation}
    E(L_1^2) = \sigma^{2}\sum_{j=1}^{p}\frac{1}{\lambda_j} 
\end{equation}
\newpage
\section{Variance Inflation Factor}
We know that the diagonal elements of the \textbf{C} = $\mathbf{X'X}^{-1}$ matrix are very useful in detecting multicollinearity. Recall from Eq. (6) that $C_{jj}$ , the $j_{th}$
diagonal element of \textbf{C} , can be written as  $C_{jj} = (1-R_j^2)^{-1}$
, where $R_j^2$ is the coefficient
of determination obtained when $x_j$ is regressed on the remaining p − 1 regressors. If $x_j$ is nearly orthogonal to the remaining regressors, $R_j^2$ is small and $C_{jj}$ is close to
unity, while if $x_{j}$ is nearly linearly dependent on some subset of the remaining regressors,
$R_j^2$ is near unity and $C_{jj}$ is large. Since the variance of the j th regression
coeffi cients is $C_{jj}\sigma^2$
 , we can view $C_{jj}$ as the factor by which the variance of ˆ
$\beta_{j}$
 is
increased due to near - linear dependences among the regressors.
\\
We call, 
\begin{equation}
    VIF_j = C_{jj} = (1-R_j^2)^{-1}
\end{equation}
 the variance inflation factor.  Practical experience indicates that if any of the VIFs exceeds 5 or 10,
it is an indication that the associated regression coeffi cients are poorly estimated
because of multicollinearity. 
\subsection{Condition Number}
 The characteristic roots or eigenvalues of $\mathbf{X'X}$ , say $\lambda_1$ , $\lambda_2$ , . . . , $\lambda_p$ , can be used
to measure the extent of multicollinearity in the data. If there are one or more near - linear dependences in the data, then one or more of the characteristic roots
will be small. One or more small eigenvalues imply that there are near - linear dependences
among the columns of \textbf{X} . Some analysts prefer to examine the condition
number of $\mathbf{X'X}$ , defined as
\begin{equation}
    \kappa = \frac{\lambda_{max}}{\lambda_{min}}
\end{equation}
 This is just a measure of the spread in the eigenvalue spectrum of X′X . Generally,
if the condition number is less than 100, there is no serious problem with multicollinearity.
Condition numbers between 100 and 1000 imply moderate to strong multicollinearity,
and if κ exceeds 1000, severe multicollinearity is indicated. 
\\
The condition indices of the $\mathbf{X'X}$ matrix are
\begin{center}
    $\kappa_j$ = $\frac{\lambda_{max}}{\lambda_{j}}$ , j = 1,2,...p
\end{center}
\newpage
\section{Endogenous Regressors}
\subsection{Classical Assumptions of OLS}
Following are the classical assumptions of the OLS :\\
1. The regression model is linear in the coefficients and the error term\\
2. The error term has a population mean of zero\\
3. All independent variables are uncorrelated with the error term\\
4. Observations of the error term are uncorrelated with each other\\
5. The error term has a constant variance (no heteroscedasticity)\\
6. No independent variable is a perfect linear function of other explanatory variables\\
7. The error term is normally distributed (optional)\\
 
For the classical regression model,
\begin{equation}
    \pmb{y = X \mathbf{\beta} + \epsilon}
\end{equation}
The following must hold true for OLS to be carried out :\\
1. $E(\epsilon_i|X_i)$ = 0 (Weak Exogeneity Principle)\\
2. $(X_i,Y_i)$ , i= 1,2,....N are independently and identically distributed\\
3. Big outliers are unlikely.\\

\subsection{Endogenous Regressors}
When $E(\epsilon_i|X_i)$ $\ne$ 0, $X_i$ is said to be weakly endogenous.\\ Sources of Endogeneity :\\ 
1. Omitted variables\\
2. Errors in variables\\
3. Simultaneity\\
\newpage
\section{Instrumental Variable Estimation}
A basic assumption in analyzing the performance of estimators in a multiple regression is that the
explanatory variables and disturbance terms are independently distributed. The violation of such assumption
disturbs the optimal properties of the estimators. The instrumental variable estimation method helps in
estimating the regression coefficients in multiple linear regression model when such violation occurs.\\
Suppose one or more explanatory variables is correlated with the disturbances in the limit, then we can write
\begin{center}
    plim($\frac{1}{n}\mathbf(X'\epsilon)$) $\ne$ 0
\end{center}
The consequences of such an assumption on ordinary least squares estimator are as follows:\\
\begin{center}
    $\hat{\pmb{\beta}} = \mathbf{(X'X)^{-1}X'y}$\\
    $\pmb{\beta} = \mathbf{(X'X)^{-1}X'(X\beta + \epsilon)}$\\
    $\hat{\pmb{\beta}} - \pmb{\beta} = \mathbf{(X'X)^{-1}X'\epsilon}$\\
    =$\mathbf{(\frac{X'X}{n})^{-1}(\frac{X'\epsilon}{n}})$\\
    $plim(\hat{\pmb{\beta}} - \pmb{\beta}) = plim(\mathbf{(\frac{X'X}{n})^{-1}}plim(\mathbf{(\frac{X'\epsilon}{n})^{-1}}$\\
     $plim(\hat{\pmb{\beta}} - \pmb{\beta}) = \ne 0$
\end{center}
\\
Consequently, $plim(\hat{\pmb{\beta}}) \ne \pmb{\beta}$, and thus OLS becomes an unbiased estimator of $\pmb{\beta}$.\\
To overcome this problem and to obtain a consistent estimator of β, the instrumental variable estimation can be used.\\ \\
Suppose that it is possible to find a data matrix \textbf{Z} of order (n x k) with the following properties :\\
(i) $plim(\mathbf{(\frac{Z'X}{n})} = \sum_{ZX}$ is a finite and nonsingular matrix of full rank. This interprets that the variables in
\textbf{Z} are correlated with those in \textbf{X} , in the limit.\\
(ii) $plim(\mathbf{(\frac{Z'\epsilon}{n})} = 0$\\
i.e., the variables in \textbf{Z} are uncorrelated with $\pmb{\epsilon}$ , in the limit.\\
(iii) $plim(\mathbf{(\frac{Z'Z}{n})} = \sum_{ZZ}$ exists\\ \\
Thus Z − variables are postulated to be\\
1. uncorrelated with ε , in the limit and\\
2. to have nonzero cross product with X.\\
Such variables are called instrumental variables.\\
The instrumental variable estimator of $\pmb{\beta}$ is \\
\begin{equation}
    \pmb{\hat{\beta}_{IV}} = \mathbf{(Z'X)^{-1}Z'y}
\end{equation}
The instrumental estimator satisfies, $plim(\pmb{\hat{\beta}_{IV}}) = \pmb{\beta}$
\newpage
\section{Panel Data Regression}
Cross-sectional data is the data collected on several
individuals/units at one point in time. Time series data data collected on one individual/unit over
several time periods. The combination of these two data is known as Panel Data Regression. Panel data are repeated cross-sections over time, in essence there
will be space as well as time dimensions. There are two types of model for panel data, Fixed and Random Effects Models.\\
The various models for Panel Data are as follows :

\subsection{Pooled Estimator}
This is the simplest estimator for the Panel Data It essentialy ignores the panel structre of the data and uses OLS assuming the classical assumptions of OLS estimator. It is the easiest model avaialble but is essentialy not suitable for our use as it ignores the panel structure of the data.

\subsection{Fixed Effects Model}
When using FE we assume that something within the individual may impact or bias the
predictor or outcome variables and we need to control for this. This is the rationale behind
the assumption of the correlation between entity’s error term and predictor variables. FE
remove the effect of those time-invariant characteristics so we can assess the net effect of
the predictors on the outcome variable.
Another important assumption of the FE model is that those time-invariant characteristics
are unique to the individual and should not be correlated with other individual
characteristics. Each entity is different therefore the entity’s error term and the constant
(which captures individual characteristics) should not be correlated with the others. If the
error terms are correlated, then FE is no suitable since inferences may not be correct and
you need to model that relationship (probably using random-effects), this is the main
rationale for the Hausman test (presented later on in this document).\\
The equation for the fixed effects model becomes:
\begin{equation}
    Y_{it} = \beta_iX_{it} + \alpha_i + \epsilon_{it}
\end{equation}
Where\\
- $\alpha_i$ is the unknown intercept for each entity (
n entity-specific intercepts).\\
- $Y_{it}$  is the dependent variable (DV) where i = entity and
t = time.\\
- $X_{it}$ represents one independent variable (IV), \\
- $\beta_i$ is the coefficient for that IV,\\
- $\epsilon_{it}$ is the error term.\\
The fixed-effects model controls for all time-invariant
differences between the individuals, so the estimated
coefficients of the fixed-effects models cannot be biased
because of omitted time-invariant characteristics…\\

\subsection{Random Effects Model}
The rationale behind random effects model is that, unlike the fixed effects model,
the variation across entities is assumed to be random and uncorrelated with the
predictor or independent variables included in the model.
An advantage of random effects is that you can include time invariant variables. In the fixed effects model these variables are absorbed by the intercept.
Random effects assume that the entity’s error term is not correlated with the
predictors which allows for time-invariant variables to play a role as explanatory
variables.
In random-effects you need to specify those individual characteristics that may or
may not influence the predictor variables. The problem with this is that some
variables may not be available therefore leading to omitted variable bias in the
model. \\
 The random effects model is:
\begin{equation}
    Y_{it} = \betaX_{it} + \epsilon_{it}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \epsilon_{it} = \alpha_i + \eta_{it}
\end{equation}
\subsection{Fixed Effects vs Random Effects Model}
To decide between fixed or random effects you can run a Hausman test where the
null hypothesis is that the preferred model is random effects vs. the alternative the
fixed effects (see Green, 2008, chapter 9). It basically tests whether the unique
errors $\epsilon_i$ are correlated with the regressors, the null hypothesis is they are not.

\section{Data}
Our paper analyzes the cause of the wrong relationship between unemployment rate and GDP growth as shown by the previous work.
The previous paper used the cross sectional data for 74 countries and did a regression for GDP growth as the dependent variable and fertility rate, unemployment rate, gross savings rate and GINI coefficient as the independent variables. The data was collected for the year 2007.\\
But the regression on the 74 countries is not suitable for showing the correct relationship. A better way is to use the Time Series data instead and form a regression on the time series data for different countries and compare the results for all countries as different simulations of the same model and then analyzing the data and finding patterns in the relationships between developed and developing countries.\\
THe previous paper used the percent change of GDP as our dependent variable (y) and decided on a range of five years, 2007-2012,
in order to capture the short and medium economic growth rate.\\
i.e. the measure for GDP growth in year 2007 used was
\begin{center}
    GDP growth(\%) = $\frac{(GDP per capita(year-2012)-GDP per capita(year-2007))}{GDP per capita(year-2007)} * 100\%$
\end{center}
The measure used in our work for GDP growth is the World Bank data for annual GDP growth rate(\%). The rest of the data consists of fertility rate, unemployment rate, gross savings rate and GINI coefficient for 11 Countries, consisting of 4 developed and 7 developing countries for a year range of 14 years from 2002 to 2016, taken from the World Bank. There was no missing data and the 14 year range from 2002-2016 remains descriptive of the relationships between the regressors\\\\
The countries have been classified as developing and developed countries.These two categories were created using the World Bank
classification system: Within the dataset, countries which have an income of \$12,736 or more were classified as the developed, while a zero is placed for countries which have an income lower than \$12,736 were classified as the developing countries.\\
\subsection{Previous Results}
Overall, the OLS regression models showed that inequality and economic growth share a positive
relationship.  By obtaining data from the World Bank, sample size of 74 countries were constructed and the utilization of independent variables such as the Gini coefficient, gross
savings rate, unemployment, and fertility to measure economic growth (change in GDP per capita for the
period 2007-2012). In addition to the Gini coefficient, the analysis showed that gross savings rate,
unemployment, and fertility all possessed positive impacts on economic growth for the time period of 2007 to 2012.

\section{Results}

The results of the Linear Regression Model :
\begin{equation}
    Gdpchange = \beta_0 + \beta_1GINI + \beta_2Gsavs + \beta_3Unemp + \beta_4Fer + \epsilon
\end{equation}
for the 11 countries have been shown in detail in the Appendix.\\
The value of the coefficients of fertilty rate and unemployment rate in the above regression model for the 11 countries along with the Class(high income or low income) is as follow :\\
The COUNTRY 1:\\
Unemployment: -1.1872
Fertility rate: -51.527
Country’s Class:  high income class\\
COUNTRY 2:\\
Unemployment: 7.9485
Fertility Rate: -17.0472
Country’s Class: high income class\\
COUNTRY 3:\\
Unemployment:  -0.182
Fertility Rate:  1.8242 
Country’s Class:  low income class\\
COUNTRY 4:\\
Unemployment:  -1.34
Fertility Rate:  2.974
Country’s Class:  low income class\\
COUNTRY 5:\\
Unemployment:  -2.25
Fertility Rate:  -14.699
Country’s Class:  high income class\\
COUNTRY 6:\\
Unemployment:  0.85
Fertility Rate:  -2.084
Country’s Class:  high income class\\
COUNTRY 7:\\
Unemployment:  -1.252
Fertility Rate:  -3.683
Country’s Class:  low income class\\
COUNTRY 8:\\
Unemployment:  2.057
Fertility Rate:  89.04
Country’s Class:  low income class\\
COUNTRY 9:\\
Unemployment:  -1.462
Fertility Rate:  -0.2495
Country’s Class:  low income class\\
COUNTRY 10:\\
Unemployment:  3.263
Fertility Rate:  8.8507
Country’s Class:  low income class\\
COUNTRY 11:\\
Unemployment:  -2.209
Fertility Rate:  -1.038
Country’s Class:  low income class\\

So, the complete statistics of the results is as follows :\\
Data for developed Countries:\\
Total no. : 4\\
Number of countries with negative coefficient of unemployment rate: 2/4\\
Number of countries with negative coefficient of fertility rate: 4/4\\
Data for developing Countries:\\
Total no. : 7\\
Number of countries with negative coefficient of unemployment rate: 5/7\\
Number of countries with negative coefficient of fertility rate: 3/7\\

The results shown above clearly indicate the developed countries have a NEGATIVE relationship between fertility rate and GDP growth rate. It was expected as the previous literature points out towards the fact that the Fertility Rate increases in the initial stage of the economic growth and then becomes stagnant as the economy reaches a stable stage and gradually begins to decrease with the country falling in the category of the developed ones.\\

However for the developing countries, there is no clear relationship between the fertility rate and the GDP growth rate.\\

\subsection{Multicollinearity Analysis}
It is necessary to perform a Multicollinearity to be sure that the OLS carried is the unbiased estimator of the Model Coefficients.
For the Multicollinearity, the Varinace Inflation Factor was calculated for all regressors for all 11 Models. The detailed results are as follows,
\graphicspath{ {./vif/} }
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics{vif.png}
\end{center}
As we know that the VIF $<$ 5 means that the data is free of Multicollinearity and the analysis shows unbiased results but we can clearly see that the VIF for unemployment rate, gini coefficient and fertility rate all exceed 5 for 4 Models. Gross savings on the other hand has VIF $<$ 5 for all 11 Models. This warrents a possible relationship present between unemployment rate, gini coefficient and fertility rate. Since, these 3 can be correlated in only one manner i.e. all 3 are corrleated together which calls for the analysis of the Subset regression to identify the Most correlated regressor in these 3 and to drop that regressor.

\subsection{Subset Regression}
In order to identify the most suitable regressor to be dropped from the Model, we carried out the Subset Regression of all the the correlated regressors. Three models were constructed as follows:\\\\
Model 1 with fertility rate dropped from the initial model:
\begin{equation}
    Gdpchange = \beta_0 + \beta_1GINI + \beta_2Gsavs + \beta_3Unemp + \epsilon
\end{equation}
Model 1 with unemployment rate dropped from the initial model:
\begin{equation}
    Gdpchange = \beta_0 + \beta_1GINI + \beta_2Gsavs + \beta_3Fer + \epsilon
\end{equation}
Model 1 with GINI dropped from the initial model:
\begin{equation}
    Gdpchange = \beta_0 + \beta_1Unemp+ \beta_2Gsavs + \beta_3Fer + \epsilon
\end{equation}
The value of the $R^2$ statsitic for the three models is as follows :
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics{Rsq.png}
\end{center}
Since the value of the $R^2$ is the highest for the Model with the fertility rate dropped, we drop it from our initial Model to solve the problem of Multicollinearity.

\subsection{New Proposed Model}
The Model proposed by us is the one with the fertility rate dropped from  initial model:
\begin{equation}
    Gdpchange = \beta_0 + \beta_1GINI + \beta_2Gsavs + \beta_3Unemp + \epsilon
\end{equation}
So, the coefficients of the unemployment in the above model for 11 countries is as follows :\\
Country 1:\\
Unemp :	-1.211
Economy:    developed\\
Country 2:\\
Unemp :	18.67
Economy:    developed\\
Country 3:\\
Unemp :	-.2921
Economy:    developing\\
Country 4:\\
Unemp :	-1.3277
Economy:    developing\\
Country 5:\\
Unemp :	-1.7439
Economy:    developed\\
Country 6:\\
Unemp :	0.766
Economy:    developed\\
Country 7:\\
Unemp :	-0.754
Economy:    developing\\
Country 8:\\
Unemp :	1.227
Economy:    developing\\
Country 9:\\
Unemp :	-1.46
Economy:    developing\\
Country 10:\\
Unemp :	3.569
Economy:    developing\\
Country 11:\\
Unemp :	-2.305
Economy:    developing\\

So, the complete statistics of the results is as follows :\\
Data for developed Countries:\\
Total no. : 4\\
Number of countries with negative coefficient of unemployment rate: 2/4\\
Data for developing Countries:\\
Total no. : 7\\
Number of countries with negative coefficient of unemployment rate: 5/7\\

The unemployment rate shows expected results, for the devloping countries, a clear majority of the countries show a negative relationship between the unemployment rate and GDP growth rate as expected b the OKUN's Law. However no clear relationship is clear for the unemployment rate and GDP growth in the developed ones.\\
These resuts can be attributed to the fact that the developed countries have a grant allocation for the unemployed population whereas the developing countries have no such grant available. Therefore, the unemployment has no such clear relationship with the GDP growth in the developed ones. But  for the case of he developing countries, the relationship is clear, in accordance with the OKUN's Law due to the fact that the developing countries have nothing to offer to he unemployed population and the uemployed population proves to be detrimental to the economy. The unemployed population generally indulges in the criminal activities and various other anti-societal activities and causes the overall economy to suffer.

\section{Panel Data Regression}
Since the data available with us contains both time series and cross-sectional data, we can apply Panel Data Regression for the Panel Data avaialble. The Panel Data Regression is carried out for the time series data for 14 years from 2002 to 2016 for 11 countries.
\subsection{With Pooled OLS Estimator}
The statistics for the estimator are as follows :\\
P value for unemp : 0.59315\\
n=11, T=15, N=165\\
Coefficient for unemp = 0.0416
\subsection{With Between Estimator}
The statistics for the estimator are as follows :\\
P value for unemp = 0.001775\\
Coefficient for unemp = 0.191344
\subsection{With Within Estimator of Fixed Effects Model}
The statistics for the estimator are as follows :\\
Pvalue for unemp = 1.11e-05\\
Coefficient for unemp = -0.7652
\subsection{With Random Effects Estimator}
The statistics for the estimator are as follows :\\
Pvalue for unemp = 0.59314\\
Coefficient for unemp = .0416
\subsection{LM Test for Random Effects vs Pooled OLS}
\includegraphics{lmr.png}\\
So, Random Effects turns out to be better than Pooled Estimator
\subsection{LM Test for Fixed Effects vs Pooled OLS}
\includegraphics{lmf.png}\\
So, Fixed Effects turns out to be better than Pooled Estimator
\subsection{LM Test for Fixed Effects vs Random Effects}
\includegraphics{rf.png}\\
Since, one of the model is inconsistent, therefore Random Effects turns out to be better than Pooled Estimator.\\
So, fixed effects Model is the best model for panel data regression.\\
The coefficient for the unemployment in the Fixed Effects Model is -0.76523, negative as expected from the Okun's law.

\section{Conclusion}
The work concludes that the reason for the opposed relationship between unemployment rate and GDP growth in the previous work done by .... was due to the strong Multicollinearity present in the data. The unemployment rate, fertility rate and GINI coefficient were strongly correlated. On producing subset regression of the initial model by removing the above regressors one by one, we concluded that the model with fertility rate removed produces the one with the highest value of $R^2$ which is indicative of the fact that fertility rate is the best explained by the rest of the regressors and thus needed to be removed.\\
After removing the fertility rate, we found that the relationship between unemployment rate and GDP growth differs with the economy from a developed to a developing one. So, upon analyzing we found that the unemployment has a clear negative reationship with economic growth in developing countries and not a clear relationship in developed ones. This can be attributed to the fact that the developed countries have an allocated grant for the unemployed population whereas the developing countries have no such grant which leads to the above relationship.\\
For the relationship between fertility rate and GDP growth, we removed GINI coefficient which was the 2nd most correlated regressor. Upon performing the regression again for the 11 countries, we found that the developed countries have a NEGATIVE relationship between fertility rate and GDP growth rate. It was expected as the previous literature points out towards the fact that the Fertility Rate increases in the initial stage of the economic growth and then becomes stagnant as the economy reaches a stable stage and gradually begins to decrease with the country falling in the category of the developed ones. However for the developing countries, there is no clear relationship between the fertility rate and the GDP growth rate.\\
After performing the panel data regression for cross sectional data for 11 countries and the time series available for the years 2002-2016, we found that the fixed effects and random effects model were both better than pooled OLS estimator by LM Hausman Test an fixed effects to be better than random effetcs. The fixed effects model had Coefficient for unemp -0.7652 and p-value of  1.11e-05.\\
Due to the missing data, we had to go with just countries. But the different relationship between fertilty rate and economic growth for developed and developing countries is an intersting topic for further research. Better data and accountability, especially in regards to the Gini
coefficient, would also help for further research and analysis.\newpage
